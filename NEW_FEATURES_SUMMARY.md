- 😌 **Chill & Relaxed** - Low energy, moderate valence for relaxation
- 💪 **Energetic & Intense** - Very high energy, high tempo workout music
- 😔 **Melancholic & Reflective** - Low valence, introspective tracks
- 🎯 **Focus & Concentration** - Mid energy, instrumental-friendly study music
- 🕺 **Party & Dance** - High danceability, energetic party tracks
- 🌙 **Late Night Vibes** - Smooth, low energy evening tracks
- 🌅 **Morning Energy** - Positive, moderate energy morning tracks

**Key Features:**
- Weighted scoring algorithm for accurate mood matching (0-100 score)
- Synthetic audio feature generation for tracks without metadata
- Customizable minimum mood scores and playlist sizes
- JSON export for easy integration
- Comprehensive statistics and analytics

**Usage:**
```python
from mood_playlist_generator import MoodPlaylistGenerator, MoodCategory

generator = MoodPlaylistGenerator()
generator.load_tracks()
generator.generate_mood_playlists(min_score=60.0)
generator.print_playlist(MoodCategory.HAPPY_UPBEAT)
generator.export_playlist(MoodCategory.FOCUS)
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
python analytics/mood_playlist_generator.py

- Valence (musical positiveness) + Energy + Tempo + Danceability
- Different weights for different moods (configurable)
- Range-based matching with distance penalties

**Temporal Analysis:**
- Time series decomposition by hour/day/week
- Streak calculation with consecutive day tracking
- Weighted recent activity for current patterns
- Genre-time correlation analysis

**Viral Prediction:**
- Momentum = rate of change in engagement
- Acceleration = rate of change of momentum (2nd derivative)
- Cross-platform velocity = spread speed across platforms
- Peak prediction using momentum + acceleration + current score
